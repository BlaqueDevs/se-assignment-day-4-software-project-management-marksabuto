## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Comparison of Agile and Waterfall Methodologies
Feature	Agile	Waterfall
Approach	Iterative & flexible	Linear & structured
Project Phases	Multiple cycles (sprints)	Sequential (fixed phases)
Flexibility	High – Changes are easily integrated	Low – Changes are costly and difficult
Delivery	Continuous, small increments	One-time final delivery
Client Involvement	High – Regular feedback	Low – Involvement mainly at the beginning
Testing	Ongoing throughout development	Performed after development phase
Best For	Complex, evolving projects	Well-defined, stable projects
Advantages and Disadvantages
Methodology	Advantages	Disadvantages
Agile	Faster feedback, adaptability, high collaboration	Hard to predict cost/time, requires experienced team
Waterfall	Clear structure, easy to manage, good for fixed requirements	Rigid, costly to change, late testing phase

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
When Agile is More Beneficial
Best for: Projects with evolving requirements, frequent feedback, and high uncertainty.

Examples:

Software Startups – Developing a new app with changing user needs.
E-commerce Platforms – Continuous updates based on customer behavior.
AI & Machine Learning Projects – Requires iterative testing and tuning.
Game Development – Frequent user testing and feature adjustments.
When Waterfall is More Beneficial
Best for: Projects with fixed requirements, strict deadlines, and regulatory constraints.

Examples:

Government Contracts – Clear scope, budget, and regulations.
Banking & Finance Software – Requires high security and compliance.
Construction Projects – Follows a sequential process from design to execution.
Medical Device Software – Must meet strict legal and safety standards.
Conclusion
Use Agile for innovation-driven, flexible projects.
